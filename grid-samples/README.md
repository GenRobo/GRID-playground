GRID consists of a model bank composed of several foundation models as well as an LLM (currently GPT-4) for orchestration and code generation. 

Running `/GRID/chat2grid.py` will open up a conversation with the LLM in GRID, where users can start by controlling the drone in AirGen through language commands, or pose more interesting perception-action problems that the LLM can start writing code for. Here is an example:
