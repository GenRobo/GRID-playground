# General Robot Intelligence Development (GRID) 

GRID is a platform built by Scaled Foundations for seamless infusion of safe intelligence into your robots. 

GRID is composed of high-fidelity simulation, state of the art AI foundation models, and development and deployment pipelines. GRID represents several robotic form factors, and can be used for building several robotics skills across perception, planning, and control; or to capture massive amounts of synthetic data to train intelligent robots. To know more about our vision and technology, please visit our [website](https://scaledfoundations.ai), check out our [blogs](https://www.scaledfoundations.ai/research#blogs), or read our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00887).

GRID is available in two flavors:

- Open GRID - A fully web-based platform to develop, train, validate and deploy intelligent robots faster, with no installation required. Visit https://grid.scaledfoundations.com to start building now!
- GRID Enterprise - A packaged enterprise version for a scalable, customizable and private robot training experience. See https://www.scaledfoundations.ai/product/grid-enterprise for more details.

This repository contains several sample configurations and Python notebooks intended for use with the GRID platform.
